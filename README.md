# peg-sol-ai

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

This is a simple implementation of DFS, DFS, and A* intelligent search using several 'naive' heuristics. The objective of this project is to see the performance of a intelligent search algorithm in a generic browser, the practical applications of which could be fairly interesting given better heuristic evaluation tools.

This is done using ember js web framework. You can see the demo here: https://nicklewanowicz.github.io/peg-solitaire-ai/
